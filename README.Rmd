# Overview

We want to illustrate assembly of a reproducible analysis
using a dataset we care about. Our workflow closely
follows that of Jenny Bryan's 
[packages-report-EXAMPLE](https://github.com/jennybc/packages-report-EXAMPLE)
on GitHub.

Several years ago, [Potti et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/nm1491) 
claimed to have found a way to use microarray profiles of a specific 
panel of cell lines (the NCI60) to predict cancer patient response 
to chemotherapeutics from a similar profile of the patient's tumor. 
Using different subsets of cell lines, they made predictions for several 
different drugs. We wanted to apply their method, so we asked
them to send us lists of which cell lines were used to make
predictions for which drugs. The method doesn't work; we 
describe our full analyses 
[here](https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aoas/1267453942).

The first dataset we received from Potti et al didn't have the
cell lines labeled. We want to see if we can identify where the 
numbers came from and see if there were any oddities that should
have raised red flags early on. 

# Brief Results

* [01_gather_data](results/01_gather_data.md) downloads the 
  raw datasets used from the web.
* [02_describing_raw_data](results/02_describing_raw_data.md)
  both summarizes background information about the datasets in 
  question and describes what we can see by looking at the 
  structure of the data with minimal processing.
* [03_preprocessing_data_base_r_version](results/03_preprocessing_data_base_r_version.md) reorganizes the datasets into matrices of expression values
  and data frames of annotation using consistent names. 
* [04_check_sample_matches_and_corrs](results/04_check_sample_matches_and_corrs.md)
  establishes the mappings desired.
* [05_report_matches_to_potti_columns](results/05_report_matches_to_potti_columns.md)

# Running the Analysis

Roughly, our analyses involve running the R and Rmd files
in [R](R) in the order they appear. 

Run [R/95_make_clean.R](R/95_make_clean.R) to clear out any
downstream products.

Run [R/99_make_all.R](R/99_make_all.R) to re-run the analysis 
from beginning to end, including generating this README.

Raw data from the web is stored in [data][data].

Reports and interim results are stored in [results][results].

## Required Libraries

These analyses were performed in RStudio 1.1.414 using 
`r version[["version.string"]]`, 
and use (in alphabetical order):

* downloader `r packageVersion("downloader")`
* GEOquery   `r packageVersion("GEOquery")`
* here       `r packageVersion("here")`
* lattice    `r packageVersion("lattice")`
* magrittr   `r packageVersion("magrittr")`
* readr      `r packageVersion("readr")`
* rmarkdown  `r packageVersion("rmarkdown")`
* tidyr      `r packageVersion("tidyr")`
